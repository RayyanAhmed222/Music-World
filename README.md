🎵 Genre-Based Music Portfolio Website
This project is a fully responsive and interactive music portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It is designed to highlight artists based on four major music genres: Rap, Rock, Classical, and Pop. Each genre section features comprehensive artist profiles that include personal background, musical journey, and a curated discography.

The site incorporates dynamic song integration using JavaScript to allow users to explore and interact with audio content directly on the platform. Additionally, it includes a “New Releases & Events” section to keep users informed about upcoming albums, concerts, and music-related events.

An engaging carousel is used to visually present educational content on musical instruments and production techniques, offering users both entertainment and insight into the behind-the-scenes aspects of music creation.

This project served as a practical exploration of:

🎨 UI/UX design with Bootstrap

🎼 Multimedia integration via JavaScript

📱 Responsive layout techniques

🧩 Genre-based content structuring

Whether you're an artist, a music enthusiast, or a frontend developer, this project demonstrates the potential of combining structured content with interactive design to create a rich and engaging user experience.
